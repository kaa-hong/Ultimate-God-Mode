# Ultimate-God-Mode
## Welcome!
You may have come here from the [Steam workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1710233598) on the Ultimate God Mode mod. This repo's primary purpose is to allow players to download the mod's main files to make things easier and less technical to play the mod with more extensive mods such as Millennium Dawn, Equestria at War, etc. All of which are known as overhaul mods. These mods tend to overwrite everything including Ultimate God Mode's files. However, there is a technical workaround to get both mods working, which requires the movement of mod files. 

Now if you have some technical knowledge, you may move the mod's files downloaded from the Steam Workshop into the overhaul mod and play but to make things easier, I have created a release within this repo that includes all the things you need. There will soon be releases which are exclusively compatible with each overhaul mod.

Check releases to download the mod's files. There will be a guide on how it is done!
